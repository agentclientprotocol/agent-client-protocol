The [agent-client-protocol](https://crates.io/crates/agent-client-protocol)
Rust crate provides implementations of both sides of the Agent Client Protocol
that you can use to build your own agent server or client.

The `agent-server-protocol` library is based on two key traits, [Agent] and
[Client], which you'll need to implement if you're building an ACP server or
client, respectively. The crate includes
[example-server](https://github.com/zed-industries/agent-client-protocol/blob/main/rust/example_server.rs)
and
[example-client](https://github.com/zed-industries/agent-client-protocol/blob/main/rust/example_client.rs)
binaries that you can use to understand how these traits work, and as a starting
point for your own tool.

To get started, add the crate as a dependency to your project's `Cargo.toml`:

```console
cargo add agent-client-protocol
```

You can read the full documentation for the library on
[docs.rs](https://docs.rs/agent-client-protocol/latest/agent_client_protocol/).

## Users

The `agent-client-protocol` crate powers the integration with external agents in
the [Zed](https://zed.dev) editor.
