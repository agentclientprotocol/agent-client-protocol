The [agent-client-protocol](https://crates.io/crates/agent-client-protocol) Rust
crate provides implementations of both sides of the Agent Client Protocol that
you can use to build your own agent server or client.

To get started, add the crate as a dependency to your project's `Cargo.toml`:

```bash
cargo add agent-client-protocol
```

Depending on what kind of tool you're building, you'll need to implement either
the
[Agent](https://docs.rs/agent-client-protocol/latest/agent_client_protocol/trait.Agent.html)
trait or the
[Client](https://docs.rs/agent-client-protocol/latest/agent_client_protocol/trait.Client.html)
trait to define the interaction with the ACP counterpart.

The
[agent](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/rust-sdk/blob/main/examples/agent.rs)
and
[client](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/rust-sdk/blob/main/examples/client.rs)
example binaries provide runnable examples of how to do this, which you can use
as a starting point.

You can read the full documentation for the `agent-client-protocol` crate on
[docs.rs](https://docs.rs/agent-client-protocol/latest/agent_client_protocol/).

## Users

The `agent-client-protocol` crate powers the integration with external agents in
the [Zed](https://zed.dev) editor.
