title: "Addition of Metrics for Agents"
---

Author(s): [forsythetony](https://github.com/forsythetony)

## Elevator pitch

> What are you proposing to change?

The addition of configuring collection of OpenTelemetry (OTEL) metrics over ACP. Metrics could be collected by the editor over ACP from agents that support exporting of those metrics.

## Status quo

> How do things work today and what problems does this cause? Why would we change things?

ACP does not currently have a way of establishing the export of OTEL metrics which agents like Gemini and Claude Code currently support:

- [Observability with OpenTelemetry | Gemini CLI](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/telemetry/#_top)
- [Monitoring - Claude Code Docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/monitoring-usage)

Users of agents (especially when using multiple agents) would benifit from having greater insight into the cost and performance of agents as they're running them. Allowing them to make more informed decisions when choosing agents for tasks.


> What are you proposing to improve the situation?

_Note: These thoughts are just brainstorming while a larger conversation is started_

We could add support in the protocol for establishing the export of OTEL metrics back to the editor/IDE for agents that support the feature. It could be as simple as passing along some extra setup instructions during initiation for supported agents.

"Please start up agent `A` and configure exporting of metrics to the listener I've configured at `x.x.x.x:XXXX`."

### What alternative approaches did you consider, and why did you settle on this one?

None. The idea came to me fully formed, like Athena springing from Zeus's head.
