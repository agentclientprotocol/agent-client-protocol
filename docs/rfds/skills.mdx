title: "Skills Discovery and Delivery"

## Elevator pitch

Define first-class **Skills** in ACP so agents, clients, and proxies can discover and load skill metadata and content in a consistent way. Align with the open agent skills standard (SKILL.md + references/scripts/assets) while keeping the ACP surface area small and transport-agnostic (direct ACP or MCP resources).

## Status quo

Skills exist today as **tool-specific filesystem conventions**:

- Each client defines its own discovery paths and activation heuristics.
- ACP only mentions skills indirectly in the proxy-chains RFD; there is no protocol-level contract for listing or fetching skills.
- Proxies can inject instructions, but there is no standardized metadata, no cross-client interoperability, and no way for an agent to ask, “what skills are available?”

This leads to:

- Fragmented discovery and inconsistent activation.
- Reduced portability of skills across clients.
- Difficulty for proxies or agents to expose or request skills programmatically.

## What we propose to do about it

Introduce an **optional Skills capability** in ACP that standardizes discovery and retrieval while remaining compatible with existing skill packaging.

At a high level:

1. **Skill metadata contract**
   - A `SkillDescriptor` includes required fields compatible with the open standard (name + description) plus ACP metadata:
     - `name`: string (unique key)
     - `description`: string
     - `version?`: string
     - `source?`: enum (agent, client, proxy, external)
     - `uri?`: string (content location, e.g., ACP or MCP resource URI)
     - `updatedAt?`: string (ISO 8601)
     - `checksum?`: string (optional integrity)

2. **Discovery and retrieval**
   - Add a `skills/list` request/response returning `SkillDescriptor[]`.
   - Add a `skills/get` request/response that returns the **SKILL.md** content (and optionally reference/script manifests).
   - Agents can request skill content lazily.

3. **Transport options**
   - If MCP-over-ACP is available, skill content may be surfaced as MCP resources and `skills/get` can return resource URIs.
   - Otherwise, `skills/get` can return inline SKILL.md content and optional manifests.

4. **Compatibility with the open standard**
   - ACP does not re-define file layout; it adopts the SKILL.md frontmatter as the canonical metadata source.
   - References/scripts/assets remain optional and discoverable via the `skills/get` response or MCP resources.

This keeps ACP small while giving clients and agents a consistent, interoperable skills surface.

## Shiny future

- Agents can always ask “what skills are available?” and load details only when needed.
- Proxies can inject or augment skills in a standard way.
- Skills move between clients without repackaging or bespoke integrations.
- The ecosystem converges on a shared contract without losing flexibility in storage or transport.

## Implementation details and plan

> Optional for initial draft; fill in after discussion.

A likely phased plan:

1. Define `SkillDescriptor` and the `skills/list` + `skills/get` methods in the spec and schemas.
2. Update proxy guidance and MCP-over-ACP docs to describe skill resource mapping.
3. Add SDK support (Rust and TypeScript) and generator updates.
4. Update docs and examples to show skill discovery and retrieval.

## Frequently asked questions

## Why not rely only on MCP resources?

MCP is a transport mechanism, not a semantic contract for “skills.” ACP needs a small skills contract so agents and clients can enumerate and request skills predictably, whether or not MCP is available.

## Does this replace filesystem skills?

No. Filesystem layout remains a local implementation detail. ACP simply standardizes how skills are exposed over the protocol.

## How large can skills be?

Large skills should be fetched lazily. `skills/get` can return a manifest and/or MCP resource URIs so that clients fetch only what’s needed.

## Who owns skill sources?

Skills can be provided by the client, agent, or proxy. The `source` field indicates provenance without enforcing policy.

### What alternative approaches did you consider, and why did you settle on this one?

- **Do nothing**: keeps interoperability fragmented and pushes burden onto every client.
- **Proxy-only guidance**: too indirect and does not define an ACP contract for skills.

The proposed approach is minimal while enabling cross-client interoperability.
