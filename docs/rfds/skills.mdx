## Elevator pitch

Define first-class **Skills** discovery in ACP so agents and clients can enumerate skills consistently and power `/skills` and `$` UX. Align with [the open agent skills standard](https://agentskills.io/) (SKILL.md + references/scripts/assets) while keeping the ACP surface area small.

## Status quo

Skills exist today as **tool-specific filesystem conventions** that are not directly exposed via ACP at all:

- Each client defines its own discovery paths and activation heuristics.
- ACP only mentions skills indirectly in the proxy-chains RFD; there is no protocol-level contract for listing or fetching skills.
- Proxies can inject instructions, but there is no standardized metadata, no cross-client interoperability, and no way for an agent to ask, “what skills are available?”
- Users have to know what skills are available by heart rather than using the standard `$`/`/skills` discovery mechanisms.

This leads to:

- Fragmented discovery and inconsistent activation.
- Reduced portability of skills across clients.
- Difficulty for proxies or agents to expose or request skills programmatically.

## What we propose to do about it

Introduce an **optional Skills capability** in ACP that standardizes discovery while remaining compatible with existing skill packaging.

At a high level:

1. **Skill metadata contract**
   - A `SkillDescriptor` includes required fields compatible with the open standard (name + description) plus ACP metadata:
     - `name`: string (unique key)
     - `description`: string
     - `version?`: string
     - `updatedAt?`: string (ISO 8601)
     - `checksum?`: string (optional integrity)

2. **Discovery**
   - Add a `skills/list` request/response returning `SkillDescriptor[]`.
   - This is sufficient for `/skills` and `$` pickers without requiring any skill content transfer.

3. **Client UX hooks**
   - Recommend a `/skills` slash command via `available_commands_update` when the Skills capability is present.
   - Clients may treat `$` as a UI affordance to open a skills picker backed by `skills/list`.
   - `/` and `$` are client-side conventions; ACP only defines the discovery data and the `available_commands_update` signal.

4. **Compatibility with the open standard**
   - ACP does not re-define file layout; it adopts the SKILL.md frontmatter as the canonical metadata source.
   - ACP does not define installation or execution. It only lets clients discover what the agent already exposes.

This keeps ACP small while giving clients and agents a consistent, interoperable skills surface.

## Non-goals

- Define how skills are installed, updated, or executed.
- Allow clients or proxies to inject or override agent skills.
- Standardize filesystem paths or activation heuristics.

## Shiny future

- Users can type `$` to open a skills picker (client UX) or run `/skills` to list available skills.
- Agents can always ask “what skills are available?” and get a consistent list.
- Skills move between clients without repackaging or bespoke integrations.
- The ecosystem converges on a shared contract without losing flexibility in storage or transport.

## Implementation details and plan

> Optional for initial draft; fill in after discussion.

A likely phased plan:

1. Define `SkillDescriptor` and the `skills/list` method in the spec and schemas.
2. Add SDK support (Rust and TypeScript) and generator updates.
3. Update docs and examples to show skill discovery, `/skills`, and `$` UX guidance.
4. If needed, add `skills/get` for richer previews of SKILL.md content without requiring the agent to surface it in conversation.

## Frequently asked questions

## Why not rely only on filesystem conventions?

Filesystem conventions are local and tool-specific. ACP needs a small, explicit contract so clients can discover skills consistently across agents and hosts without hard-coding paths or heuristics.

## Does this replace filesystem skills?

No. Filesystem layout remains a local implementation detail. ACP simply standardizes how skills are exposed over the protocol. It does not define how skills are installed or injected; it only lets clients discover what the agent already exposes.

## Who owns skills?

Agents own the skills they expose. ACP does not define client-side or proxy-defined skills; it only reports what the agent makes available.

## Why would we ever add `skills/get`?

Discovery is the primary goal. A follow-up `skills/get` is only for richer previews (e.g., showing SKILL.md details or reference lists in the UI) without the agent spending tokens to restate that content in the chat. It is not a way to execute skills, install them, or inject new ones.

## How does this relate to slash commands and `$` lookup?

`/skills` should be a normal slash command advertised via `available_commands_update` when the Skills capability is present. `$` is a client-side UX affordance that opens a skills picker backed by `skills/list`; it does not introduce a new ACP message.

### What alternative approaches did you consider, and why did you settle on this one?

- **Do nothing**: keeps interoperability fragmented and pushes burden onto every client.
- **Proxy-only guidance**: too indirect and does not define an ACP contract for skills.

The proposed approach is minimal while enabling cross-client interoperability.
