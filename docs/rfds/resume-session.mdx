title: "Resuming of existing sessions"
---

Author(s): [@josevalim](https://github.com/josevalim)

## Elevator pitch

> What are you proposing to change?

We propose adding the ability to resume existing sessions. This is similar to "session/load",
except it does not return previous messages.

## Status quo

> How do things work today and what problems does this cause? Why would we change things?

While the spec provides a "session/load" command, most coding agents do not implement it.
This means that, once you close your editor, browser, etc, you can't resume the conversation.

Given resuming an existing conversation is already a capability in some agents and genereally
easier to implement in practice, we hope it will be better adopted. Not only that, resuming
could be used as a mechanism for proxies and adapter libraries to emulate "session/load". 

## What we propose to do about it

> What are you proposing to improve the situation?

Two possible options:

* Add a "session/resume" command
* Add an option to "session/load" which allows us to continue even if
  it doesn't return the previous conversation

In the rest of the document, I will refer to the solution as "session/resume",
but it implies any of the solutions above.

## Shiny future

> How will things will play out once this feature exists?

We will be able to resume existing conversations, providing a better user experience.

Not only that, if an agent does not implement "session/load" but it does implement
"session/resume", it is now possible to implement a proxy/adapter that intercepts
the agents messages and writes them to disk. Now when the client issues a
"session/load", the proxy/adapter converts it to a "session/resume", and then returns
the stored messages.

### What alternative approaches did you consider, and why did you settle on this one?

The biggest question is if it makes sense to support both "session/load" and
"session/resume". However, I do wonder: how portable "session/load" is in practice?

When we start a new session over ACP, we introduce custom MCP tools and configuration.
This means that, while we could use "session/load" to load our own chats, loading
third-party chats would likely lead to a flawed user experience, as our tools would
not be available. And depending on the ACP implementation, not even the capabilities
would be respected (as loading a third-party session would not include our capabilities
in its history, misleading the agent).

Therefore, if we assume "session/load" is for loading conversations started by the client
itself, "session/resume" is effectively a subset of "session/load", decoupled from storage
mechanics. If an agent implements "session/load", then it can be used directly, but if it
doesn't, a proxy or adapter can provide a reasonable fallback on top of "session/resume".
This argues "session/resume" is the basic primitive which "session/load" builds on top of.
