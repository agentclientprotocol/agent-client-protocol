title: "Resuming of existing sessions"
---

Author(s): [@josevalim](https://github.com/josevalim)

## Elevator pitch

> What are you proposing to change?

We propose adding the ability to resume existing sessions. This is similar to session/load,
except it does not return previous messages.

## Status quo

> How do things work today and what problems does this cause? Why would we change things?

While the spec provides a "session/load" command, most coding agents do not implement it.
This means that, once you close your editor, browser, etc, you can't resume the conversation.

An obvious answer to this question would be to implement "session/load" for existing coding
agents. For example, `claude-code-acp` could intercept all messages, write them to disk,
and emulate "session/load". We considered contributing this when we realized that, we already
store all messages in our own application, independent from ACP, given we want to provide
users to navigate or share old chats even if the coding agent is removed. And if we were to use
"session/load", we would likely just discard them anyway.

In those cases, the ability to resume a session is beneficial because:

* it is exactly what we need
* it is more straight-forward to implement for both clients and servers

## What we propose to do about it

> What are you proposing to improve the situation?

Two possible options:

* Add a "session/resume" command
* Add an option to "session/load" which allows us to continue even if
  it doesn't return the previous conversation

In the rest of the document, I will refer to the solution as "session/resume",
but it implies any of the solutions above.

## Shiny future

> How will things will play out once this feature exists?

We will be able to resume existing conversations, providing a better user experience.

### What alternative approaches did you consider, and why did you settle on this one?

The biggest question is if it makes sense to support both "session/load" and
"session/resume". However, I do wonder: how portable "session/load" is in practice?

When we start a new session over ACP, we introduce custom MCP tools and configuration.
This means that, while we could use "session/load" to load our own chats and chats
not started by us, I presume loading third-party chats would lead to a flawed user
experience, as our tools would not be available. And depending on the ACP implementation,
not even the capabilities would be respected.

Therefore, I see functionality such as "session/load" and "session/list" being
useful for those who want to provide a different interface for coding agents, without
injecting custom functionality. Outside of that, the other benefit of "session/load"
is that we could rely on the coding agent's own storage, but unfortunately that does
not seem to be exposed at the moment. So if we have to emulate "session/load" at the
ACP layer, we may know have chats stored in the coding agent, in ACP, and in our
applications.

If we can trivially implement "session/load" across agents, then I don't believe this
RFD has weight. But assuming we don't, we may need to deal with these trade-offs:

* If "session/resume" exists, coding agents may avoid implementing "session/load",
  hurting those who want a "session/list" and "session/load" style functionality

* If "session/resume" does not exist, coding agents may still not implement "session/load"
  anyway, and clients will be unable to resume conversations (this is where we are)
