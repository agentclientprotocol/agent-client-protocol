## Elevator pitch

Add a mechanism for agents to advertise available [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/specification) to clients. Skills are reusable, composable capabilities that agents can expose, allowing clients to discover what an agent can do beyond basic prompting. This RFD proposes:

1. A canonical `AvailableSkill` type describing skill schema aligned with the [Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io/specification)
2. An `AvailableSkillsUpdate` session notification for streaming skill availability to clients

## Status quo

Currently, the ACP protocol provides `AvailableCommand` and `AvailableCommandsUpdate` for agents to advertise executable commands. However, commands are designed for user-invoked actions within a session (e.g., `/create_plan`, `/research_codebase`), not for describing higher-level agent capabilities that:

- Have licensing or compatibility requirements
- Need pre-approved tool access for security
- Represent modular, composable functionality
- Require rich metadata for discovery and filtering

This creates several problems:

- **Limited capability discovery** - Clients cannot understand what specialized skills an agent offers
- **No licensing visibility** - Users cannot see license terms for specific agent capabilities
- **Missing compatibility info** - No way to indicate if a skill requires specific environments, network access, or system packages
- **Security blind spots** - No pre-declaration of tools a skill might use, making trust decisions difficult
- **Poor extensibility** - Commands lack a metadata mechanism for custom integrations

## What we propose to do about it

Add a new `AvailableSkill` type and `AvailableSkillsUpdate` notification following the existing pattern for `AvailableCommand` and `AvailableCommandsUpdate`. The schema aligns with the [Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io/specification).

### AvailableSkill Schema

| Field           | Required | Constraints                                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`          | Yes      | Max 64 characters. Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only. Must not start or end with a hyphen. No consecutive hyphens. |
| `description`   | Yes      | Max 1024 characters. Non-empty. Describes what the skill does and when to use it.                                             |
| `license`       | No       | License name or reference to a bundled license file (e.g., `MIT`, `Apache-2.0`, `./licenses/my-license.txt`).                 |
| `compatibility` | No       | Max 500 characters. Indicates environment requirements (intended product, system packages, network access, etc.).             |
| `metadata`      | No       | Arbitrary string key-value mapping for additional properties.                                                                 |
| `allowedTools`  | No       | Array of pre-approved tools the skill may use (Experimental).                                                                 |

### Session Notification

The `AvailableSkillsUpdate` notification allows agents to stream skill availability during a session:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "session/update",
  "params": {
    "sessionId": "sess_abc123",
    "sessionUpdate": "available_skills_update",
    "availableSkills": [
      {
        "name": "code-review",
        "description": "Performs automated code review on staged changes..."
      },
      {
        "name": "test-generator",
        "description": "Generates unit tests for the specified code...",
        "allowedTools": ["Bash", "Read", "Write"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Shiny future

Once this feature exists:

1. **Rich skill discovery** - Clients can browse available skills with detailed metadata, enabling better agent selection and capability understanding
2. **License compliance** - Organizations can filter or highlight skills based on licensing requirements
3. **Environment matching** - Clients can warn users when skills may not work in their environment (e.g., missing git, no network access)
4. **Security pre-approval** - Users can review and pre-approve tool access for skills, reducing permission fatigue
5. **Extensible integrations** - The `metadata` field enables custom integrations without protocol changes
6. **Skill marketplaces** - Future tooling could aggregate skills across agents for discovery and comparison

Clients could implement:

- Skill browser/selector UI
- Automatic environment compatibility checking
- License filtering for enterprise compliance
- Skill-based agent recommendations

## Implementation details and plan

### Phase 1: Schema Updates

1. **Add `AvailableSkill` type** to schema:
   - `name`: Required string with validation pattern `^[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?$`, max 64 chars
   - `description`: Required string, max 1024 chars, minLength 1
   - `license`: Optional string
   - `compatibility`: Optional string, max 500 chars
   - `allowedTools`: Optional array of strings
   - `_meta`: Standard extensibility field, we can put metadata from the skills spec

2. **Add `AvailableSkillsUpdate` type**:
   - `availableSkills`: Required array of `AvailableSkill`
   - `_meta`: Standard extensibility field

3. **Update `SessionUpdate` enum** to include `available_skills_update` variant

### Phase 2: SDK Updates

4. **Update Rust SDK** (`src/`):
   - Add `AvailableSkill` struct with serde validation
   - Add `AvailableSkillsUpdate` struct
   - Update `SessionUpdate` enum

### Phase 3: Documentation

5. **Update protocol documentation**:
   - Document the new types
   - Provide usage examples
   - Link to [Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) for skill authoring guidance
