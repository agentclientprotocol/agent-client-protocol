description: "How the Agent Client Protocol works"
---

The Agent Client Protocol allows [Agents](#agent) and [Clients](#client) to communicate by exposing methods that each side can call and sending notifications to inform each other of events.

## Communication Model

The protocol follows [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) specifications with two types of messages:

- **Methods**: Request-response pairs that expect a result or error
- **Notifications**: One-way messages that don't expect a response

Both sides expose methods, making the protocol symmetric - Agents can call Client methods and Clients can call Agent methods.

## Message Flow

A typical conversation follows this pattern:

<Steps>
<Step title="Initialization Phase">
   - Client → Agent: `initialize` to establish connection
   - Client → Agent: `authenticate` if required by the Agent
</Step>

<Step title="Session Setup">
  Either: - Client → Agent: `session/new` to create a new session - Client →
  Agent: `session/load` to resume an existing session if supported
</Step>

<Step title="Prompt Turn">
   - Client → Agent: `session/prompt` to send user message
   - Agent → Client: `session/update` notifications for progress updates
   - Agent → Client: File operations or permission requests as needed
   - Client → Agent: `session/cancel` to interrupt processing if needed
   - Turn ends and the Agent sends the `session/prompt` response with a stop reason
</Step>
</Steps>

## Agent

Agents are programs that use generative AI to autonomously modify code. They typically run as subprocesses of the Client.

### Baseline Methods

<ParamField path="initialize">
  Establish connection and negotiate capabilities.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="authenticate">
  Authenticate with the Agent (if required).
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="session/new">Create a new conversation session.</ParamField>

<ParamField path="session/prompt">Send user prompts to the Agent.</ParamField>

### Optional Methods

<ParamField path="session/load">
  Load an existing session (requires `loadSession` capability).
</ParamField>

### Notifications

<ParamField path="session/cancel">
  Cancel ongoing operations (no response expected).
</ParamField>

## Client

Clients provide the interface between users and agents. They are typically code editors (IDEs, text editors) but can also be other UIs for interacting with agents. Clients manage the environment, handle user interactions, and control access to resources.

### Baseline Methods

<ParamField path="session/request_permission">
  Request user authorization for tool calls.
</ParamField>

### Optional Methods

<ParamField path="fs/read_text_file">
  Read file contents (requires `fs.readTextFile` capability).
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="fs/write_text_file">
  Write file contents (requires `fs.writeTextFile` capability).
</ParamField>

### Notifications

<ParamField path="session/update">
  Send progress updates during prompt processing (no response expected).
</ParamField>

## Argument requirements

- All file paths in the protocol **MUST** be absolute.
- Line numbers are 1-based

## Error Handling

All methods follow standard JSON-RPC 2.0 [error handling](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#error_object):

- Successful responses include a `result` field
- Errors include an `error` object with `code` and `message`
- Notifications never receive responses (success or error)

## Next Steps

- Learn about [Initialization](./initialization) to understand version and capability negotiation
- Understand [Session Setup](./session-setup) for creating and loading sessions
- Review the [Prompt Turn](./prompt-turn) lifecycle
