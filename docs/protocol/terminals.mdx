The terminal methods allow Agents to execute shell commands within the Client's environment. These methods enable Agents to run build processes, execute scripts, and interact with command-line tools while providing real-time output streaming and process control.

## Checking Support

Before attempting to use terminal methods, Agents **MUST** verify that the Client supports this capability by checking the [Client Capabilities](./initialization#client-capabilities) field in the `initialize` response:

```json highlight={7}
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 0,
  "result": {
    "protocolVersion": 1,
    "clientCapabilities": {
      "terminal": true
    }
  }
}
```

If `terminal` is `false` or not present, the Agent **MUST NOT** attempt to call any terminal methods.

## Executing Commands

The `terminal/create` method starts a command in a new terminal:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 5,
  "method": "terminal/create",
  "params": {
    "sessionId": "sess_abc123def456",
    "command": "npm",
    "args": ["test", "--coverage"],
    "env": [
      {
        "name": "NODE_ENV",
        "value": "test"
      }
    ],
    "cwd": "/home/user/project",
    "outputByteLimit": 1048576
  }
}
```

<ParamField path="sessionId" type="SessionId" required>
  The [Session ID](./session-setup#session-id) for this request
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="command" type="string" required>
  The command to execute
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="args" type="string[]">
  Optional array of command arguments
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="env" type="EnvVariable[]">
  Optional environment variables for the command.

Each variable has:

- `name`: The environment variable name
- `value`: The environment variable value

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="cwd" type="string">
  Optional working directory for the command (absolute path)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="outputByteLimit" type="number">
  Optional maximum number of output bytes to retain. Once exceeded, earlier
  output is truncated to stay within this limit.
</ParamField>

The Client returns a Terminal ID immediately without waiting for completion:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 5,
  "result": {
    "terminalId": "term_xyz789"
  }
}
```

This allows the command to run in the background while the Agent performs other operations.

After creating the terminal, the Agent can use the `terminal/wait_for_exit` method to wait for the command to complete.

<Note>
  The Agent **MUST** release the terminal using `terminal/release` when it's no
  longer needed.
</Note>

## Embedding in Tool Calls

Terminals can be embedded directly in [tool calls](./tool-calls) to provide real-time output to users:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "session/update",
  "params": {
    "sessionId": "sess_abc123def456",
    "update": {
      "sessionUpdate": "tool_call",
      "toolCallId": "call_002",
      "title": "Running tests",
      "kind": "execute",
      "status": "in_progress",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "terminal",
          "terminalId": "term_xyz789"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

When a terminal is embedded in a tool call, the Client displays live output as it's generated and continues to display it even after the terminal is released.

## Getting Output

The `terminal/output` method retrieves the current terminal output without waiting for the command to complete:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 6,
  "method": "terminal/output",
  "params": {
    "sessionId": "sess_abc123def456",
    "terminalId": "term_xyz789"
  }
}
```

The Client responds with the current output and exit status (if the command has finished):

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 6,
  "result": {
    "output": "Running tests...\nâœ“ All tests passed (42 total)\n",
    "truncated": false,
    "exitStatus": {
      "exitCode": 0,
      "signal": null
    }
  }
}
```

<ResponseField name="output" type="string" required>
  The terminal output captured so far
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="truncated" type="boolean" required>
  Whether the output was truncated due to byte limits
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="exitStatus" type="TerminalExitStatus">
  Present only if the command has exited. Contains:

- `exitCode`: The process exit code (may be null)
- `signal`: The signal that terminated the process (may be null)

</ResponseField>

## Waiting for Exit

The `terminal/wait_for_exit` method returns once the command completes:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 7,
  "method": "terminal/wait_for_exit",
  "params": {
    "sessionId": "sess_abc123def456",
    "terminalId": "term_xyz789"
  }
}
```

The Client responds once the command exits:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 7,
  "result": {
    "exitCode": 0,
    "signal": null
  }
}
```

<ResponseField name="exitCode" type="number">
  The process exit code (may be null if terminated by signal)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="signal" type="string">
  The signal that terminated the process (may be null if exited normally)
</ResponseField>

## Killing Commands

The `terminal/kill` method terminates a command without releasing the terminal:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 8,
  "method": "terminal/kill",
  "params": {
    "sessionId": "sess_abc123def456",
    "terminalId": "term_xyz789"
  }
}
```

After killing a command, the terminal remains valid and can be used with:

- `terminal/output` to get the final output
- `terminal/wait_for_exit` to get the exit status

The Agent **MUST** still call `terminal/release` when it's done using it.

### Building a Timeout

Agents can implement command timeouts by combining terminal methods:

1. Create a terminal with `terminal/create`
2. Start a timer for the desired timeout duration
3. Concurrently wait for either the timer to expire or `terminal/wait_for_exit` to return
4. If the timer expires first:
   - Call `terminal/kill` to terminate the command
   - Call `terminal/output` to retrieve any final output
   - Include the output in the response to the model
5. Call `terminal/release` when done

## Releasing Terminals

The `terminal/release` kills the command if still running and releases all resources:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 9,
  "method": "terminal/release",
  "params": {
    "sessionId": "sess_abc123def456",
    "terminalId": "term_xyz789"
  }
}
```

After release the terminal ID becomes invalid for all other `terminal/*` methods.

If the terminal was added to a tool call, the client **SHOULD** continue to display its output after release.
