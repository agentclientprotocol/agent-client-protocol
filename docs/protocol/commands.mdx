Agents can advertise a set of slash commands that users can invoke. These commands provide quick access to specific agent capabilities and workflows.

## Advertising commands

After creating a session, the Agent **MAY** send a list of available commands via the `available_commands_update` session notification:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "session/update",
  "params": {
    "sessionId": "sess_abc123def456",
    "update": {
      "sessionUpdate": "available_commands_update",
      "availableCommands": [
        {
          "name": "web",
          "description": "Search the web for information",
          "input": {
            "hint": "query to search for"
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "test",
          "description": "Run tests for the current project"
        },
        {
          "name": "plan",
          "description": "Create a detailed implementation plan",
          "input": {
            "hint": "description of what to plan"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

<ResponseField name="availableCommands" type="AvailableCommand[]">
  The list of commands available in this session
</ResponseField>

### AvailableCommand

<ResponseField name="name" type="string" required>
  The command name (e.g., "web", "test", "plan")
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="description" type="string" required>
  Human-readable description of what the command does
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="input" type="AvailableCommandInput">
  Optional input specification for the command
</ResponseField>

### AvailableCommandInput

Currently supports unstructured text input:

<ResponseField name="hint" type="string" required>
  A brief description of the expected input
</ResponseField>

## Command lifecycle

1. **Discovery**: The Agent sends available commands after session creation
2. **Display**: The Client displays these commands in its UI (e.g., in a slash command menu)
3. **Invocation**: When the user selects a command, the Client includes it in the prompt
4. **Execution**: The Agent processes the command as part of the prompt

Commands are not a separate protocol mechanism - they are simply a way for the Agent to advertise what slash commands it understands. The actual command invocation happens through the regular prompt mechanism.

## Dynamic updates

The Agent can update the list of available commands at any time during a session by sending another `available_commands_update` notification. This allows commands to be:

- Added based on context (e.g., project type detection)
- Removed when no longer relevant
- Modified with updated descriptions or input hints

Clients may also add their own local commands (e.g., authentication commands) to the list before displaying them to users.

## Example usage

When a user types `/web climate change` in the Client, it would send:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 3,
  "method": "session/prompt",
  "params": {
    "sessionId": "sess_abc123def456",
    "prompt": {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "/web climate change"
    }
  }
}
```

The Agent recognizes the command prefix and processes it accordingly, potentially using web search tools to gather information about climate change.
